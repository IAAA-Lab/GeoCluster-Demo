# Datasets
This directory contains datasets that have not been used for experiments. Feel free to try them.

* Aggregation: this is a synthetic dataset of points that might get good results with DBSCAN algorithm.

* bil: this is a dataset containing the localities near Bilbao, Spain. Every feature has its polygonal geometry and a numeric attribute - its population.

* Compound: same as Aggregation. It migth also work well with DBSCAN, but it could be harder to clusterize.

* D31: same as Aggregation. It could be harder to clusterize with DBSCAN.

* ESP_adm_shp: this is a dataset containing the geometry of every administrative area in Spain. It has multiple uses because it contains complex information.

* flame: same as Aggregation.

* jain: same as Aggregation. Could be interesting to test DBSCAN with this because clusters dont have uniform densities.

* mad: same as bil, but in the area of Madrid.

* pathbased: same as Aggregation.

* sev: same as bil, but in the area of Seville.

* spiral: same as Aggregation. Could be difficult to use DBSCAN and get good results because clusters have a decreasing density in progressive points of the space.

* vlc: same as bil, but in the area of Valencia.
